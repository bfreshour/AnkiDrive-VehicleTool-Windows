# AnkiDrive-VehicleTool-Windows
Initial commit of a Windows 10 Anki Overdrive vehicle tool command line project.  I realize the code is spaghetti at the moment and many things are not implemented.  

When you launch the application, it begins scanning for cars.  After you hit a key, it lists the cars for you and you can connect to one.  The only implemented commands are: ping, get-version, and get-battery.
